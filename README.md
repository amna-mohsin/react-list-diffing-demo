# React List Diffing Demo – Rendering, Key Props & Re-rendering

A beginner-friendly React application built with **Vite.js** that demonstrates **list rendering**, **diffing**, and **re-rendering logic** using unique keys. The app allows users to remove items from a list, showing how React updates only the changed elements efficiently.

---

## Overview

This project illustrates how React handles **dynamic lists** and **efficient DOM updates**. It is ideal for beginners who want to understand:

* React state management with `useState`
* Rendering lists using `.map()`
* Importance of **key props** in React
* React's diffing algorithm and re-rendering behavior
* Controlled updates in a simple UI
* Component-based UI structure

---

## Key Features

* **List Rendering:** Dynamically renders items from an array
* **Remove Items:** Users can remove items from the list with a button click
* **Key Prop Usage:** Each list item has a unique `key` to optimize rendering
* **Efficient Re-rendering:** Only updated elements are re-rendered
* **Clean UI:** Minimal and readable styling using CSS
* **Fast Setup:** Built with Vite for quick development
